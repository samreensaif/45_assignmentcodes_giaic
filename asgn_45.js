//45. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function cars(manufacturer, modelName, ...options) {
    let carInfo = {
        manufacturer,
        modelName,
        ...Object.assign({}, ...options)
    };
    return carInfo;
}
let carsInfo = cars(" Toyota", "Corolla", { color: "black" }, { features: [` navigation`, `power staering`] });
console.log(carsInfo);
export {};
